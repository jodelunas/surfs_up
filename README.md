## Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to filter the date column of the Measurements table for the temperatures for the months of June and December. From these lists of temperatures I created a DataFrame of summary statistics.

## Results

The temperatures don't vary a whole lot between the months, but there were a few differences.
* The average temperature for December is a few degrees lower than June.
* The minimum temperature for December was 8° lower.
* The maximum temperature is only 2° lower for December.
